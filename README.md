My personal site developed in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

The previous version of the site was written in Gatsby. I shifted to Hugo because
I like the simplicity and speed of the Hugo. Rewritten completed in just few hours
of hacking.

Also sometimes I happen to struggle with managing version updates of Gatsby more
than actually maintaining the site. It's was a pain. I hope I won't find those or
will find it quite rarely with Hugo.

Kudos to the simple theme which I use: [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)
