## Build Tools for Daily Live

I feel stuck on the personal projects that I work on. I can say with some confident that at some point you will feel or have felt the same. It just all starts with adrenaline rush which doesn't last longer.

It is _very_ important that the projects you build excites you. Otherwise you will abandon it and feel guilty again!

One way to keep the provocation going on is create what you need right now. Think about any mundane work and if you can automate it through coding just start doing it.

> More mundane the work, bigger the drive to fix it.

At the end you get a tool which helps you. Also which is created by you.

## Others Can Benefit Too

The problem which you are having there is a great chance others might be going through the same. If you manage to create that tool, open-souring it will help them too.
