Hello World! Welcome to my space on the Internet. My name is Mohammad Aziz I'm a
software developer at [Zoop.one](https://zoop.one). My role is as Full-Stack
Developer. That means, I wear many of hats ðŸŽ©.

Nowadays, I'm reading a book by [Shaw Wang](https://twitter.com/swyx) on
[coding career](https://twitter.com/coding_career) and inspired by the book I
decided to do what I wanted to do since about a year. I purchased
https://iAziz786.com and started my journey today.

I will start writing about the things I learn each day at work. Maybe I won't be
writing about them each day but after a couple of days, combining my findings
and write about. I hope you find this a interesting place to be at and I'll try
to provide as valuable information possible.

I'm keeping this blog short for now because I'm very tired today and also
because I need to push these codes just now.

To wrap up, this is the context about the platform. I'm a JavaScript
developer that means you can expect posts about TypeScript, Node.js, React.js
and may more things. I'm also interested in Go but don't use it more frequently
at work so my experience with Go is not as good as JavaScript but it's
improving.
