It is important to ask _what_ you should be working on, but since most side projects are abandon is that even the right question at start?

If you are not pushing you work beyond finish line, how do you know it is good or bad? The excitement fades away and you start questionning is this a wrong idea?

I want to tell you that you should keep working on your wrong ideas.

## What is a wrong idea?

You tell me. I won't judge and neither should others.

> Without hard work there are no wrong ideas

The good "wrong ideas" are the ones you discover, not the one you ruminate.

And you discover by sheer amount of hard work you put on them. You can't just come on day 4 and say it isn't worth it.

## Over emphesize it!

If you are a builder, over emphasize the output of your work. I have made the mistake by being very rational about it. It won't pay you as much as overstating it.

Remember, over emphasize doesn't mean being blind about it. Always critiqute your work first.

This is the path of developing self belief.

I mean sure some ideas will be garbage but you still complete it. Why are you missing the return on investment?

> The wrong ideas teaches you more than any other good ideas.

This is what matters the most, learning from them.

## Build crapy things and iterate

I don't expect myself to create best work in the first go. If I would do that I will become lucky but also doubtful.

Like this blog post itself, I know it's has many flaws but I wanted to get it out. I will do that later = I will do that never.

This isn't written on stones so I will keep updating if I find something I don't like.

But mantra is clear:

> Ship it and iterate fast

## Thik about the antidote

For whom you're doing all this? At least let that be for yourself.

What you will build people won't use it.
Antidote: Build for yourself.

My writing sucks and people won't read it.
Antidote: Write for yourself.

If the judgement is your problem then _building for yourself_ is the solution.
