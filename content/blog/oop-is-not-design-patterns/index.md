The OO concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, etc. they only provide you the building blocks. They don’t provide you with the ways of structuring your code. The design patterns are good at this. Not always, but certainly can help.

Using design patterns you develop a common language with your stakeholders. Instead of lengthy explanation, you just provide a name which immediately clicks to their mind.

Your language might not support all OO concepts. Take Go as an example, It doesn’t support inheritance. Does this means you can’t build reusable components, flexible schema, and maintainable code? You surely can! So main take away from here would be you build on top of design patterns even if you don’t have all OO elements.

You as a junior developer, you need to know that not re-inventing a lot wheels will give you leverage. You as senior engineer has responsibility that your less experienced mates are not discovering what’s already discovered. That will be a wasteful experiment.

Besides there are many criticism for the design patterns altogether. I know they are not an ideal choice. I can suggest you shouldn’t force them as defaults. The patterns means repetition and using them is art. Your brains has to click and it will do it only when you have done it many times.

So I guess the initial hurdle is how to come out of that initial threshold?
