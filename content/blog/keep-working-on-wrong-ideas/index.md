It’s important to ask what you should be working on.
But since most side projects are abandoned — is that even the right question to start with?

If you’re not pushing your work beyond the finish line, how do you know whether it’s good or bad? The excitement fades away, and you start questioning — is this a wrong idea?

I want to tell you — you should **keep working on your wrong ideas**.

## What is a wrong idea?

You tell me. I won’t judge, and neither should others.

> Without hard work, there are no wrong ideas.

The good “wrong ideas” are the ones you **discover**, not the ones you **ruminate** on.

And you discover them through the sheer amount of hard work you put in.
You can’t just come on day 4 and decide it isn’t worth it

## Over emphesize it!

If you’re a builder, overemphasize the output of your work.
I’ve made the mistake of being too rational about it — it doesn’t pay as much as overstating it.

Remember, _overemphasize_ doesn’t mean being blind about it.
Always critique your work first.

This is the path to developing **self-belief**.

Sure, some ideas will be garbage — but you should still complete them.
Why miss out on the return on investment?

> The wrong ideas teach you more than the good ones ever will.

And that’s what matters the most — **learning from them**.

## Build crapy things and iterate

I don’t expect myself to create my best work on the first go.
If I did, I’d be lucky — but also doubtful.

Like this blog post itself — I know it has many flaws, but I wanted to get it out.
“I’ll do it later” usually means _I’ll never do it_.

This isn’t written in stone, so I’ll keep updating it whenever I find something I don’t like.

But the mantra is clear:

> Ship it and iterate fast.

## Thik about the antidote

Who are you doing all this for?
At least let it be for **yourself**.

People might not use what you build.
**Antidote**: Build for yourself.

My writing might suck, and people might not read it.
**Antidote**: Write for yourself.

If judgment is your problem, then **building for yourself** is the solution.
